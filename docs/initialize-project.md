description: How to initialize a new Flow project with the CLI
---

⚠️ _Warning: CLI projects are an experimental feature. Functionality is subject to change._

```shell
flow project init
```

This command initializes an empty Flow project by creating a `flow.json` file
in the current directory.

The `flow.json` file will contain the following:
- A network list pre-populated with the Flow Emulator configuration.
- An account list pre-populated with the Flow Emulator service account.

## Example Project Configuration

TODO: add sample project config here

```json
```
