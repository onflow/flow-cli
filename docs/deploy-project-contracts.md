description: How to deploy Flow project contracts with the CLI
---

```shell
flow project deploy
```

This command automatically deploys your project's contracts based on the 
configuration defined in your `flow.json` file.

Before using this command, read about how to 
[configure project contracts and deployment targets](/tools/flow-cli/project-contracts).

## Example Usage

```shell
> flow project deploy --network=testnet

Deploying 2 contracts for accounts: my-testnet-account

NonFungibleToken -> 0x8910590293346ec4
KittyItems -> 0x8910590293346ec4

✨  All contracts deployed successfully
```

In the example above, your `flow.json` file might look something like this:

```json
{
  ...
  "contracts": {
    "NonFungibleToken": "./cadence/contracts/NonFungibleToken.cdc",
    "KittyItems": "./cadence/contracts/KittyItems.cdc"
  },
  "deployments": {
    "testnet": {
      "my-testnet-account": ["KittyItems", "NonFungibleToken"]
    }
  },
  ...
}
```

Here's a sketch of the contract source files:

```cadence:title=NonFungibleToken.cdc
pub contract NonFungibleToken { 
  // ...
}
```

```cadence:title=KittyItems.cdc
import NonFungibleToken from "./NonFungibleToken.cdc"

pub contract KittyItems { 
  // ...
}
```

## Initialization Arguments
Deploying contracts that take initialization arguments 
can be achieved with adding those arguments to the configuration. 

Each deployment can be specified as an object containing 
`name` and `args` key specifying arguments to be 
used during the deployment. Example:

```
...
  "deployments": {
    "testnet": {
      "my-testnet-account": [
        "NonFungibleToken", {
            "name": "Foo", 
            "args": [
                { "type": "String", "value": "Hello World" },
                { "type": "UInt32", "value": "10" }
            ]
        }]
    }
  }
...
```


⚠️ Warning: before proceeding, 
we recommend reading the [Flow CLI security guidelines](security.md) 
to learn about the best practices for private key storage.

## Dependency Resolution

The `deploy` command attempts to resolve the import statements in all contracts being deployed.

After the dependencies are found, the CLI will deploy the contracts in a deterministic order
such that no contract is deployed until all of its dependencies are deployed.
The command will return an error if no such ordering exists due to one or more cyclic dependencies.

In the example above, `Foo` will always be deployed before `Bar`.

## Address Replacement

After resolving all dependencies, the `deploy` command rewrites each contract so 
that its dependencies are imported from their _target addresses_ rather than their 
source file location.

The rewritten versions are then deployed to their respective targets,
leaving the original contract files unchanged.

In the example above, the `KittyItems` contract would be rewritten like this:

```cadence:title=KittyItems.cdc
import NonFungibleToken from 0xf8d6e0586b0a20c7

pub contract KittyItems { 
  // ...
}
```
## Merging Multiple Configuration Files

You can use the `-f` flag multiple times to merge several configuration files. 

If there is an overlap in any of the fields in the configuration between two or more configuration files, the value of 
the overlapped field in the resulting configuration will come from the configuration file that is on the further right 
order in the list of configuration files specified in the -f flag 

Let's look at an example of `deploy` commands with multiple configuration files below

````cadence:title=flow.json
{
    "accounts": {
        "admin-account": {
            "address": "f8d6e0586b0a20c7",
            "key": "21c5dfdeb0ff03a7a73ef39788563b62c89adea67bbb21ab95e5f710bd1d40b7"
        }, 
        "test-account": {
            "address": "f8d6e0586b0a20c8",
            "key": "52d5dfdeb0ff03a7a73ef39788563b62c89adea67bbb21ab95e5f710bd1d51c9"
        }
    }
}
````
````cadence:title=private.json
{
    "accounts":{
		"admin-account":{
			"address":"f1d6e0586b0a20c7",
			"key":"3335dfdeb0ff03a7a73ef39788563b62c89adea67bbb21ab95e5f710bd1d40b7"
	    }
	}
}
````
In the example above, when we try to use the `deploy` command with multiple configuration files and there is an overlap 
in the `admin-account` account in `accounts` field of the configuration, the resulting configuration will be like this

> flow project deploy -f flow.json -f private.json
````
{
    "accounts":{
	    "admin-account":{
			"address":"f1d6e0586b0a20c7",
			"key":"3335dfdeb0ff03a7a73ef39788563b62c89adea67bbb21ab95e5f710bd1d40b7"
	    }, 
	    "test-account":{
			"address":"f8d6e0586b0a20c8",
			"key":"52d5dfdeb0ff03a7a73ef39788563b62c89adea67bbb21ab95e5f710bd1d51c9"
	    }
	}
}
````

used to create a secure GRPC client when executing the command.

### Network

- Flag: `--network`
- Short Flag: `-n`

- Default: `emulator`

Specify which network you want the command to use for execution.

### Filter

- Flag: `--filter`
