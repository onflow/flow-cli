## Running Flow EVM

‚ö†Ô∏è **This feature is experimental in nature, and its stability cannot be guaranteed. It does not reflect the intended direction for utilizing the EVM in a production environment.** ‚ö†Ô∏è

In order to run Flow EVM you have to start the emulator with the evm flag enabled:
```
flow emulator --evm-enabled
```

You can then proceed by creating an account using the:

```
flow evm create-account {funding-amount}
```

This will create an account inside the EVM, fund it with the funding amount provided and create a bridged 
account resource which will be saved inside the Flow account that was used as a signer in the above command
(default signer is emulator account if not provided with `--signer` flag). Please be aware you can't create 
multiple accounts on a single Flow account right now as the bridged account resource is always stored 
in same place and can't be overwritten.

After creating an account you can deploy a contract to the EVM by running:

```
flow evm deploy {compiled binary}
```

You need to provide location of the file that contains the compiled EVM binary. The response will include the 
EVM address of the contract that you will later need to interact with it.

You can interact with deploy contract by calling functions using:

```
flow evm run {Flow caller address} {EVM contract address} {contract function name} --ABI {abi location}
```

The Flow caller address is the account that contains EVM bridged account resource, that will be used to 
execute the call inside the EVM. So you must first create such a resource by using the `create-account` command. 
The EVM contract address will be provided to you when `deploy` command is executed. You also need to specify the 
name of the contract function you want to call and the file containing ABI specification, which is normally produced 
in the compile process.
