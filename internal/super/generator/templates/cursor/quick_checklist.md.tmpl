# Quick Checklist

## Imports

- Use `import "ContractName"` format only.
- Include all required contract imports.

## Preconditions/Postconditions

- Single boolean expression per pre/post block.
- Use `assert()` for multi-step validation in execute.

## Capabilities & Addresses

- Validate capabilities before use.
- Pass addresses as parameters only when you must resolve third-party capabilities directly.
- For scheduled transactions: verify handler capability exists and is properly authorized.

## Test

- Zero amounts and `UFix64.max`
- Invalid capabilities
- For scheduled transactions: invalid timestamps (past), insufficient fees, missing handlers
